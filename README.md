# ScratchSVGKorrektur
The Python program ScratchSVGKorrektur corrects SVG files by replacing specific strings in the files with predefined substitutions. It filters the input filenames to process only SVGs, reads their content, performs the replacements, and saves the modified files under a new name with the suffix "_corrected".
